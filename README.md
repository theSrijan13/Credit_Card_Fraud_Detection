# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting credit card fraud. The goal of this project is to build and train a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data.
## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant problem that affects both cardholders and financial institutions. This project aims to address this issue by using machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent transactions. By building and training a robust model, we can help prevent financial losses for cardholders and reduce fraud-related costs for financial institutions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](link-to-dataset). It contains a large number of credit card transactions, some of which are fraudulent and others legitimate. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To train the model and evaluate its performance, you can run the following command:

python train_and_evaluate.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess it, train the model, and provide evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model
We use a [Scikit SnapMl] machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. The model architecture and hyperparameters are defined in the model.py file.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing in terms of fraud detection.
